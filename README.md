 For correlative microscopy. This repo is a playground lol\
 \
 Example:\
 UBF1-labeled U20S cells. 65 Î¼m scalebar\
 **A)** SEM image **B)** Fluorescene image\
 **C)** Direct overlay **D)** Overlay with shift calculated from cross-correlation

Including various other methods and approaches:
* Bandpass-masking
* Adjusting pixelsize
* Radial averages
* Spatial filtering
* Scattering/wavelet transform
* Binary masking
* Thresholding and segmentation

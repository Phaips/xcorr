 # Cross-correlation based image alignment
 
 For correlative microscopy. This repo is a playground lol\
 \
 Example:\
 UBF1-labeled U20S cells. 65 Î¼m scalebar\
 **A)** SEM image **B)** Fluorescene image\
 **C)** Direct overlay **D)** Overlay with shift calculated from cross-correlation

(note in the LM that the grid bars are dark and the edges represent the edges of the carbon mesh)

Including various other methods and approaches:
* Bandpass-masking and spatial filtering
* Adjusting pixelsize
* Fourier spectrum radial averages
* Scattering/wavelet transform
* Binary masking
* Thresholding and segmentation
